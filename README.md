# CS 534: Artificial Intelligence

Projects and notes for the WPI graduate class CS 534: Artificial Intelligence.

Projects for this class are separated into their own repositories, and added
here as submodules. To clone these as well, do:

## Project 1

Project 1 is made up of two parts. For the first part, we use both A* and
random-restart hill-climbing with a variable number of sideways moves to solve
the heavy n-queens problem.

For the second part, we use hill climbing and a genetic algorithm to solve a
simplified urban planning problem by laying out industrial, commercial, and
residential zones in an optimal placement.
